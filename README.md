# Learning Avalonia
This repo contains some of my own personal examples of code with C# Avalonia (MVVM in particular, for scalability).

## Development Notes
I am using Visual Studio 2026 with the [Avalonia for Visual Studio official extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AvaloniaTeam.AvaloniaVS).

See the [Avalonia Docs Reference](https://docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/reference) for specifics on their supported XAML elements/attributes.
